# Hospitality Analytics

## Project Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive data analysis project focused on the hospitality industry. The goal is to leverage data-driven insights to optimize business performance and operational efficiency. The project encompasses the entire data lifecycleâ€”from data ingestion and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, statistical analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.

## Data Sources and Description
The analysis uses multiple CSV files, including:
- **dim_date**: Contains date-related details such as week numbers and day types.
- **dim_hotels**: Provides hotel information including property IDs, names, categories (Luxury, Business), and locations.
- **dim_rooms**: Describes various room types and classifications (Standard, Elite, Premium, Presidential).
- **fact_aggregated_bookings**: Aggregates booking data by check-in dates, successful bookings, and capacity details.
- **fact_bookings**: Contains individual booking records including booking dates, check-in/out dates, guest counts, booking platforms, ratings, statuses, and revenue metrics.

For detailed metadata on these datasets, refer to the [Meta Data Documentation](./meta_data_hospitality.txt) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The project tracks several essential KPIs on a week-over-week (WoW) basis:
- **Revenue WoW Change %**: Percentage change in revenue between consecutive weeks.
- **Occupancy WoW Change %**: Variation in occupancy rates from week to week.
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate) WoW Change %**: Changes in the average daily rate.
- **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) WoW Change %**: Trends in revenue per available room.
- **Realisation WoW Change %**: Week-over-week change in revenue realisation.
- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) WoW Change %**: Shifts in the number of sellable room nights.


## Data Analysis Methodology
The project follows a structured data analysis approach:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Investigate data distributions, identify outliers, and understand missing value patterns.
   - Visualize key trends and correlations to drive hypothesis generation.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**  
   - Standardize and normalize data from multiple sources.
   - Merge and integrate datasets to form a consolidated data repository, ensuring high data quality.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Derive new metrics and features (e.g., WoW percentage changes) to capture complex business dynamics.
   - Utilize domain knowledge to enhance the dataset and improve model performance.

4. **Statistical Analysis and Modeling:**  
   - Apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.
   - Develop predictive models, if applicable, to forecast future trends and support decision-making.

5. **Data Visualization and Dashboarding:**  
   - Create interactive dashboards with dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities.
   - Employ best practices in data visualization to ensure clear and impactful storytelling.

## Tools and Technologies
This project leverages a variety of tools and technologies to ensure robust analysis:
- **Data Processing & Analysis:** Python, R, and SQL for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and feature engineering.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Power BI and Excel for interactive dashboarding and visual storytelling.
- **Version Control:** Git for managing code and collaboration.

## Dashboard Overview
The interactive dashboard visualizes key metrics and trends. It includes filters, dynamic charts, and drill-down features to explore the data from multiple perspectives.

## Best Practices and Data Analysis Philosophy
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:**  
  Utilize quantitative analysis to guide business strategies and operational improvements.
  
- **Iterative Analysis:**  
  Embrace an iterative process where hypotheses are continuously tested, validated, and refined.
  
- **Transparency and Reproducibility:**  
  Document each step of the analysis to ensure clarity and reproducibility of results.
  
- **Visual Storytelling:**  
  Present insights in a clear, engaging manner to support strategic discussions and decision-making.
